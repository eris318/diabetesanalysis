# Data sources
We download our dataset from the CDC website, and our data come from three sources inside the CDC website. The first is the statistical data on diagnosed diabetes. Second type of data is derived from the questionnaire result from National Center for Health Statistics. The third one is the Death data from CDC WONDER.  

The first data source is from the [U.S. Diabetes Surveillance System](https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/diabetes/DiabetesAtlas.html). You can see some choice of filter options in this page, which are National, state, county, and other indicators. For the map plot, we want to explore the diabetes distribution among the U.S., so we filter by state and choose the total number of diabetes patients. The original data downloaded from CDC is consist of 54 states every year from 2000 to 2018, and we select the year 2018 to draw our map. The type of variable we use are both categorical and discrete data. For the Cleveland plot, we use the Social Determinants option and choose the Risk Factor for Diabetes, which are Obesity and Physical Inactivity. We discover some issue on this Social Determinants data class, which is there is no state level data under this classification.  

The second data source is the [National Center for Health Statistics](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Questionnaire). In this page we can see the questionnaire from year 1999 to 2020. This questionnaire contains around 20 questions, because the NCHS add some questions in recent years. There are around 8000 participants involved every year, so we have about 8000 entries every year. We can get some known problems with the data of year 2017 to 2020, which is the NHANES program suspended field operations in March 2020 due to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. As a result, data collection for the NHANES 2019-2020 cycle was not completed. Therefore when doing our analysis using this data, we use the results from the year before 2018.  

The third data source is [CDC WONDER](https://wonder.cdc.gov/ucd-icd10.html). In this page, you can see many choice of options to filter the cause of death. We mainly interested in the death number caused by diabetes and diabetes related complications, so in the select cause of death part, we enter “diabetes” to filter the death cases caused by diabetes. We get the categorical variables for death reasons under diabetes and discrete variables for the death number. There are 10463 entries for our search results. We notice there is a small flaw if we want to use this data, which is the total population in every state is not same, which may give the reader bias opinion at the first look. We do some data transformation for this data, and we will introduce it in next part.
