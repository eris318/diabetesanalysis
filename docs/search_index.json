There are two types of Chronic diabetes, which are type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes, and they are usually non-reversible. Meanwhile, the prediabetes and gestational diabetes are potentially reversible diabetes. Diabetes patients are at risk of developing other severe complications, such as heart attacks, blurred vision, Kidney disease and failure, etc. Motivated by the this report, we decided to choose the topic on Diabetes, which could give us some insights on the background of diabetes. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources We download our dataset from the CDC website, and our data come from three sources inside the CDC website. The first is the statistical data on diagnosed diabetes. Second type of data is derived from the questionnaire result from National Center for Health Statistics. The third one is the Death data from CDC WONDER. The first data source is from the U.S. Diabetes Surveillance System. You can see some choice of filter options in this page, which are National, state, county, and other indicators. For the map plot, we want to explore the diabetes distribution among the U.S., so we filter by state and choose the total number of diabetes patients. The original data downloaded from CDC is consist of 54 states every year from 2000 to 2018, and we select the year 2018 to draw our map. The type of variable we use are both categorical and discrete data. For the Cleveland plot, we use the Social Determinants option and choose the Risk Factor for Diabetes, which are Obesity and Physical Inactivity. We discover some issue on this Social Determinants data class, which is there is no state level data under this classification. The second data source is the National Center for Health Statistics. In this page we can see the questionnaire from year 1999 to 2020. This questionnaire contains around 20 questions, because the NCHS add some questions in recent years. There are around 8000 participants involved every year, so we have about 8000 entries every year. We can get some known problems with the data of year 2017 to 2020, which is the NHANES program suspended field operations in March 2020 due to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. As a result, data collection for the NHANES 2019-2020 cycle was not completed. Therefore when doing our analysis using this data, we use the results from the year before 2018. The third data source is CDC WONDER. In this page, you can see many choice of options to filter the cause of death. We mainly interested in the death number caused by diabetes and diabetes related complications, so in the select cause of death part, we enter “diabetes” to filter the death cases caused by diabetes. We get the categorical variables for death reasons under diabetes and discrete variables for the death number. There are 10463 entries for our search results. We notice there is a small flaw if we want to use this data, which is the total population in every state is not same, which may give the reader bias opinion at the first look. We do some data transformation for this data, and we will introduce it in next part. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation In this data transformation part, we will separately introduce how we clean the three source of data. For the first data source U.S. Diabetes Surveillance System, we can see that for every dataset we downloaded in this way, there are two useless rows at the beginning, one empty column at the left, and one row showing the website at the bottom. Initially, we use skip=2 to set the according class being the column name in our dataset, such as the using the Male...Percentage being the column name. Next, we see there are some messy code before the actual column name, such as #, so we change column name to the concise label using the commands under magriittr library. Finally we can get the data in great format. We use the same process to deal with the PhysicalActivity.csv, Obeisity, and DiagnosedDiabetes.csv files. The second data source is the National Center for Health Statistics. The data downloaded from there are in .XPT form, so we use read.xport command under foreign library in R to read them. The third data source we used is from CDC WONDER. And the data is in the .txt file from, so we use readr library and the read_tsv to read them into R. After import the file into R, we notice there is an empty column at the right, and there are huge amount of metadata at the bottom. We select the useful row and column into our own data named death.
