[["index.html", "Diabetes Analysis Chapter 1 Introduction", " Diabetes Analysis Eris Chai and Tianyi Lu 2022-05-05 Chapter 1 Introduction According to a report published by the Endocrine Society at the beginning of year 2022, almost 30 million Americans have diabetes, a disease in which there is too much sugar in the patients’ bloodstream. There are two types of Chronic diabetes, which are type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes, and they are usually non-reversible. Meanwhile, prediabetes and gestational diabetes are potentially reversible diabetes. Diabetes patients are at risk of developing other severe complications, such as heart attacks, blurred vision, kidney disease and failure, etc. Motivated by this report, we decided to explore more on diabetes, which could give us some insights into the background of diabetes. Specifically, we are interested in exploring what the distribution of diabetes in the United States and the relationships of Age, Gender, and Race in diabetes can tell us. We will inspect the death rate caused by diabetes with different aspects. We will also explore how risk factors, such as obesity and physical inactivity affect the rate of diabetes in the United States. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources We download our dataset from the CDC website, and our data come from three sources inside the CDC website. The first is the statistical data from U.S. Diabetes Surveillance System. The second type of data is derived from the questionnaire result from National Center for Health Statistics. The third one is about the “Underlying Cause of Death” data from CDC WONDER. The first data source is from the U.S. Diabetes Surveillance System. You can see some choice of filter options on this page, which are National, state, county, and other indicators. For the map plot, we want to explore the diabetes distribution in the U.S., so we filter by state and choose the total number of diabetes patients. The original data downloaded from CDC is consist of 54 states every year from 2000 to 2018, and we select the year 2018 to draw our map. The types of variables we use are both categorical and discrete data. Similarly, we can classify by age, gender, race, and education to download the data. In this data source, there is also the Social Determinants option that contains Risk Factors for Diabetes including obesity, physical inactivity, social vulnerability index, etc. We discover some issues with this Social Determinants data class, which is there is no state-level data under this classification, all the data are at the county level. Another major issue with this data source is that we need to do filtering on the website. This interactive way of exploring data might be user-friendly for some people, but it does not allow us to download the entire data we need in one file. So, all our data is in pieces with a lot of CSV files. The second data source is the National Center for Health Statistics. On this page, we can see the questionnaire on diabetes from the year 1999 to 2020. This questionnaire contains around 50 questions because the NCHS add some questions in recent years. There are around 8000 participants involved every year, so we have about 8000 entries in our data. We have a problem with the newest data for the year 2017 to 2020, which is the NHANES program suspended field operations in March 2020 due to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. As a result, data collection for the NHANES 2019-2020 cycle was not completed. Therefore when doing our analysis using this data, we use the results from 2017 to 2018. The third data source is CDC WONDER. On this page, you can see many choices of options to filter the cause of death. We are mainly interested in the death number caused by diabetes and diabetes-related complications, so in the select cause of death part, we enter “diabetes” to filter the death cases caused by diabetes. We get the categorical variables for death reasons under diabetes and discrete variables for the death number. One issue about this website is that it only allows results with a maximum of 75,000 rows. But if we want to add all the filtering options we need, then the data will exceed the 75,000 rows. So we have to filter several times to get the data we need. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation In this data transformation part, we will separately introduce how we clean the three source of data. For the first data source U.S. Diabetes Surveillance System, we can see that for every CSV file we downloaded in this way, there are two useless rows on the top, one empty column at the end, and one row showing the website at the bottom. Initially, we use skip = 2 to delete the top two useless rows. Then, we found in some files the column names starting with X in the front and containing symbols such as ... inside. So, we change the column names to more concise and understandable labels. Finally, we can get the data in a nicer format. We use the same process to deal with all the data from U.S. Diabetes Surveillance System, such as Physical Inactivity, Obesity, and Diagnosed Diabetes files. The second data source is the National Center for Health Statistics. The data downloaded from there are in .XPT form, so we use read.xport command under foreign library in R to read them. The third data source we used is CDC WONDER. And the data is in the form of .txt file, so we use the readr library and the read_tsv to read them into R. After importing the file into R, we notice there is an empty bote column on the left, and there is a huge amount of metadata at the bottom. We delect the empty note column and the rows contain metadata. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values   The first missing value plot shows the missing pattern for our first data from U.S. Diabetes Surveillance System. We can see there are 50 rows of complete cases and 1 row with missing values of percentage, Lower limit, and Upper limit, and this row is Virgin Islands of the U.S. Virgin Islands of the U.S is a region consisting of some small islands in the Atlantic Ocean, where there are only one hundred thousand people there, and they are usually underrepresented in national estimates. Our data for the percentage of people with diabetes is collected based on the questionnaires sent to citizens of the United States. So, it is normal that this kind of small region has missing values. Since all other States and regions have complete data, so the missing values from a small region like the Virgin Islands of the U.S. will not affect the general analysis of diabetes in the whole United States population. We can choose to not include the missing value for the Virgin Islands of the U.S. when we analyze our data. So, we can still use this data and analyze it without loss of generality. All other data files do from U.S. Diabetes Surveillance System not have missing values.   The second missing value plot is based on our second data source, which is the questionnaire from National Center for Health Statistics. The y-axis is the codes of questions, and the x-axis represents each respondent. In the data transformation part, we have filtered our data according to the response to question DIQ010, which is whether “doctor told you have diabetes”. Since we are only interested in people who have been diagnosed with diabetes. Therefore we filter the data to include people who answered yes to this question. We can see the data from DIQ160 to DIQ180 are all missing. When we saw this many missing values, we thought we can not use this data. But as we look through all the questions inside the questionnaire, we found out that the missing values are due to the nature of the questionnaire. People will be directed to different questions based on their answers to the previous questions. There are CHECK ITEM inside the questionnaire, according to the answers to the CHECK ITEM, people will skip some questions inside the questionnaire. For example, since all the participants in our filtered data are diabetes patients, so their response to the DIQ159 CHECK ITEM is yes, and this will be directed to DIQ.050 and ignore the question from DIQ160 to DIQ180. Thus, even though there are a lot of missing values, because of the nature of the questionnaire, we think this data is still valid. All the files the third data source CDC WONDER do not have any missing values. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 1st plot 5.2 2st plot 5.3 3rd plot 5.4 4th plot 5.5 5th plot 5.6 6th plot 5.7 7th plot 5.8 8th plot 5.9 9th plot 5.10 10th plot", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 1st plot   The first plot is a map plot, which reflects the percentage of diagnosed diabetes in each state in the year 2018. We can see that West Virginia, Alabam, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Arkansas have the most percentage of diabetes patients with a range from 13.9% to 16.2%. And areas around these 5 states have relatively high percentages of diagnosed diabetes. Colorado, Utah, Wisconsin, and Wyoming shows the least diagnosed patients among American with a range from 7% to 8.8%. The states around the northwest of the U.S. have a relatively lower rate of diabetes patients compared with the states in the southeast part. 5.2 2st plot   The second plot is a time series facet plot. Originally, we were planning to use faceting by five-year intervals to show percent change over time in diagnosed diabetes from 2000 to 2018 and explore the diagnosed percentage changing trend among states in the United States. However, after working hard under the choroplethr package, we failed to facet under this package. Therefore, we decided to find 10 states with the lowest and highest diabetes percentage in 2018 and plot the percentage of diagnosed diabetes from 2000 to 2018 in these 10 states. From this time series facet plot, we can see the states with the highest diabetes percentage in 2018 double the amount of in percentage increase than the states with the lowest diabetes percentage. Meanwhile, the most recent percentage level of the lowest 5 states in 2018, which is around 8%, is just close to the beginning level of the highest states in the year 2000, almost ten years ago. 5.3 3rd plot   The third plot is the Cleveland dot plot. After exploring the diagnosed situation in the above two plots, we are curious about whether states with high diabetes diagnosis rates have high death rates caused by diabetes. Intuitively, we think the higher diagnosed rates will have higher death rates. Therefore we do a Cleveland dot plot for the year 2018 using our third data source. Considering the population differences among states and getting a clear presentative format, we divided the death number by population and multiplied by 100000 to get the death number in 100000 people. The most revealing finding here is the District of Columbia has the highest death rate, however, its diagnosed rate is not such significant. What’s more, there is not any overlap between the 10 states with the lowest and highest diabetes percentage and the 10 states with the lowest and highest death rate. 5.4 4th plot   The fourth plot is the mosaic plot. We use age, gender, race, and education as independent variables vertically in each mosaic plot, and set whether diagnosed with diabetes as a dependent variable horizontally. We can see that diabetes is more correlated with age. The older the participant is, the more likely he/she will be a diabetes patient, especially for people aged 45+. And we cannot see any obvious patterns for diabetes with gender and race. In the education against diabetes mosaic plot, we can see a negative correlation between education level and diabetes probability. People with higher education levels will have a lower probability of diabetes. 5.5 5th plot   The fifth graph is a histogram showing the age when people were first diagnosed with diabetes. Before we do the plot, intuitively, we think the probability people get diabetes will increase with age. That is the number of people in 60-80 being first diagnosed with diabetes will be higher than that of people in 40-60. However, this actual plot gives us a revealing finding, which shows the high incidence of diabetes period is aged approximately 40 to 60. Then there is an obvious decrease in the number of people being first diagnosed with diabetes at the age above 60, which is a discrepancy against our guess. But this is actually reasonable since the diagnosed diabetes is non-reversible, no matter what age people are diagnosed, they will mostly have diabetes their whole life. So, the diagnosed diabetes is a cumulative percentage and is certainly different from the distribution of age when people were first diagnosed with diabetes. But this high diagnosed percentage in 40-60 reminds people should take extra care at this age. Importantly, the topcoding problem happened at the age of 80. The value 80 in the questionnaire includes people whose ages are 80 and above. We notice the topcoding issue here, but due to the limitation of the questionnaire, we can not avoid the topcoding problem. 5.6 6th plot   The sixth graph is a heatmap. The x-axis is the Ten-Year Age Groups, and the y-axis is death reason categories by CDC. We convert the raw data of death and population into the death rate, which means the number of people die in 100000 people due to that reason. We fill the heatmap with the death rate. We use perceptually uniform color spaces to fill the heatmap. Our subjective assumption is most diabetes people died due to insulin-dependent diabetes, however, the statistical graph tells us most diabetes people died due to Unspecified diabetes reasons. And match our intuition, older people with diabetes are at a higher risk than younger people with diabetes. 5.7 7th plot   The seventh graph is a boxplot. In this graph, we want to explore the times of checking blood sugar with A1C level. The A1C test is a simple blood test that measures your average blood sugar levels over the past 3 months. Then We can see a general trend that if people check blood sugar more often, there will be fewer outliers. 5.8 8th plot   The eighth graph is a parallel coordinate plot showing the relationship between five variables, which are hypertension awareness, diagnosed diabetes, high cholesterol awareness, obesity, and physical inactivity. We can see an obvious negative relationship just as we expected between hypertension awareness and diagnosed diabetes. If people’s awareness of hypertension is high, they will less likely to get diabetes. Similarly, diabetes and high cholesterol awareness also show a negative correlation. Then the high cholesterol awareness and obesity show a weak negative correlation, which is not strong enough as the two correlations before. The last correlation is between obesity and physical inactivity. We can also observe a weak negative correlation between them, which is not what we expected. We expected these two variables to show a strong positive correlation, so we will do further analysis on this in the next plot. 5.9 9th plot   The ninth graph is the scatter plot matrix. The correlation in the parallel coordinate plot is state level not so significant, so we decide to use county-level data and explore the further relationship between diagnosed diabetes, social vulnerability index, obesity, and physical inactivity. Since there are over 3000 counties, we randomly sample the data to get this plot. The social vulnerability index refers to the potential negative effects on communities caused by external stresses on human health. In our plot, the SVI and diagnosed diabetes show a slight positive relationship. This means the more external stresses people faced, the more likely he/she will get diabetes. A more obvious positive correlation exists between diagnosed diabetes and obesity. We can also see a strong positive correlation between obesity and physical inactivity. These findings match our intuition. 5.10 10th plot   The tenth graph is a time series line chart for the total death caused by diabetes in the United States by month. We can see a cyclic trend in the plot, the death numbers often reached the peak in the January of the year. This may be due to the cold weather of the year. And we can see the death numbers went to the lowest mostly in June or September which is the summer. The increase in death numbers may be due to the cold weather of the year. When it comes to the year 2020, the death number pattern changed, as it should go down after January as the cyclical trend, instead it kept increasing dramatically until April. And even though, it started to drop after April, it still maintains higher than previous years’ peak. And December of 2020 has the highest number of deaths caused by diabetes in the past 20 years. The most likely cause for this is COVID-19. As people with chronic conditions are at a higher risk during the pandemic. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component 6.1 Instructions on how to engage 6.2 Commentary 6.3 Limitation and Improvement", " Chapter 6 Interactive component 6.1 Instructions on how to engage We do an interactive plot between diagnosed diabetes percentage and death rate from 2000 to 2018 by states. Visitors can click the legend on right to choose or cancel the state they want, and focus on which state they are interested in. By double-clicking, visitors can select a specific state to view. And by a single click, visitors can add or delete another state. Visitors can drag the slider at the bottom to view the change by year from 2000 to 2018. Visitors can also click the play button to view the animation change by year. 6.2 Commentary We can see West Virginia is a very obvious outlier, with a high diagnosed diabetes percentage and high death rate. And the situation in West Virginia is getting worse and worse each year. From the animation, we can see the correlation between diagnosed diabetes percentage and death rate changes a lot during the past 18 years. They show a highly positive relationship in the year 2000, and the positive correlation became weaker in the next years. this positive trend may be caused by the technology and medication improvement in recent two decades. Also, people’s awareness of diabetes has raised during these years. 6.3 Limitation and Improvement There is one issue in this animation, CDC data does not record the percentage of diagnosed diabetes in Hawaii in 2004. So when the animation plays to 2004, Hawaii will disappear from the plot and the other states will have another factor level without Hawaii, so the dots on the plot seems exchanged, while it is actually just reordered without Hawaii. We were originally going to add buttons in the plot to let visitors change variables and change plot types. But during the realization, we could not assign new x and y to each button, so we did not accomplish this goal. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.1 Main takeaways 7.2 Limitation 7.3 Future directions", " Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.1 Main takeaways From the statistical graph of factors on diabetes, we can get some practical takeaways for our life. For example, being overweight or obese will increase the likelihood of getting diabetes, and physical activity can help people lower the risk of getting diabetes. People should increase their awareness of hypertension and high cholesterol. Also, people should pay more attention to their blood sugar level when they enter the age of 40 because that is the high incidence of diabetes for the general population. 7.2 Limitation There are some limitations in our exploration, for example, we fail to facet on state level under choroplethr package. If we can conquer this problem, then we could see and compare the trend of diagnosed diabetes rate change during past years with respect to states. Lacking data on the District of Columbia is also our limitation. After the Cleveland dot plot, we see the District of Columbia has the highest death rate, we want to further analyze why DC has such high diabetes death rate. However, after hard-working on searching the related data, we didn’t find proper data to analyze the fact. Another limitation we want to share here is the insufficient data on type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes. We find the A1C level of diagnosed diabetes patients, but the data did not specify which category did the diabetes patient belong to. And this impedes us in analyzing the difference between diabetes. 7.3 Future directions In our future directions, we want to explore the difference between different types of diabetes, such as how to do type 1 and type 2 patients behave on taking insulin or how the blood sugar level change during pregnancy. We can also explore more about the District of Columbia and West Virginia. "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
