[["index.html", "Diabetes Analysis Chapter 1 Introduction", " Diabetes Analysis Eris Chai and Tianyi Lu 2022-05-05 Chapter 1 Introduction According to a report published by the Endocrine Society at the beginning of year 2022, almost 30 million Americans have diabetes, a disease in which there is too much sugar in the patients’ bloodstream. There are two types of Chronic diabetes, which are type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes, and they are usually non-reversible. Meanwhile, prediabetes and gestational diabetes are potentially reversible diabetes. Diabetes patients are at risk of developing other severe complications, such as heart attacks, blurred vision, kidney disease and failure, etc. Motivated by this report, we decided to explore more on diabetes, which could give us some insights into the background of diabetes. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources We download our dataset from the CDC website, and our data come from three sources inside the CDC website. The first is the statistical data from U.S. Diabetes Surveillance System. The second type of data is derived from the questionnaire result from National Center for Health Statistics. The third one is about the “Underlying Cause of Death” data from CDC WONDER. The first data source is from the U.S. Diabetes Surveillance System. You can see some choice of filter options on this page, which are National, state, county, and other indicators. For the map plot, we want to explore the diabetes distribution in the U.S., so we filter by state and choose the total number of diabetes patients. The original data downloaded from CDC is consist of 54 states every year from 2000 to 2018, and we select the year 2018 to draw our map. The types of variables we use are both categorical and discrete data. Similarly, we can classify by age, gender, race, and education to download the data. In this data source, there is also the Social Determinants option that contains Risk Factors for Diabetes including obesity, physical inactivity, social vulnerability index, etc. We discover some issues with this Social Determinants data class, which is there is no state-level data under this classification, all the data are at the county level. Another major issue with this data source is that we need to do filtering on the website. This interactive way of exploring data might be user-friendly for some people, but it does not allow us to download the entire data we need in one file. So, all our data is in pieces with a lot of CSV files. The second data source is the National Center for Health Statistics. On this page, we can see the questionnaire on diabetes from the year 1999 to 2020. This questionnaire contains around 50 questions because the NCHS add some questions in recent years. There are around 8000 participants involved every year, so we have about 8000 entries in our data. We have a problem with the newest data for the year 2017 to 2020, which is the NHANES program suspended field operations in March 2020 due to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. As a result, data collection for the NHANES 2019-2020 cycle was not completed. Therefore when doing our analysis using this data, we use the results from 2017 to 2018. The third data source is CDC WONDER. On this page, you can see many choices of options to filter the cause of death. We are mainly interested in the death number caused by diabetes and diabetes-related complications, so in the select cause of death part, we enter “diabetes” to filter the death cases caused by diabetes. We get the categorical variables for death reasons under diabetes and discrete variables for the death number. One issue about this website is that it only allows results with a maximum of 75,000 rows. But if we want to add all the filtering options we need, then the data will exceed the 75,000 rows. So we have to filter several times to get the data we need. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation In this data transformation part, we will separately introduce how we clean the three source of data. For the first data source U.S. Diabetes Surveillance System, we can see that for every CSV file we downloaded in this way, there are two useless rows on the top, one empty column at the end, and one row showing the website at the bottom. Initially, we use skip=2 to delete the top two useless rows. Then, we found in some files the column names starting with X in the front and containing symbols such as ... inside. So, we change the column names to more concise and understandable labels. Finally, we can get the data in a nicer format. We use the same process to deal with all the data from U.S. Diabetes Surveillance System, such as Physical Inactivity, Obesity, and Diagnosed Diabetes files. The second data source is the National Center for Health Statistics. The data downloaded from there are in .XPT form, so we use read.xport command under foreign library in R to read them. The third data source we used is CDC WONDER. And the data is in the form of .txt file, so we use the readr library and the read_tsv to read them into R. After importing the file into R, we notice there is an empty bote column on the left, and there is a huge amount of metadata at the bottom. We delect the empty note column and the rows contain metadata. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values   The first missing value plot shows the missing pattern for our first data from U.S. Diabetes Surveillance System. We can see there are 50 rows of complete cases and 1 row with missing values of percentage, Lower limit, and Upper limit, and this row is Virgin Islands of the U.S. Virgin Islands of the U.S is a region consisting of some small islands in the Atlantic Ocean, where there are only one hundred thousand people there, and they are usually underrepresented in national estimates. Our data for the percentage of people with diabetes is collected based on the questionnaires sent to citizens of the United States. So, it is normal that this kind of small region has missing values. Since all other States and regions have complete data, so the missing values from a small region like the Virgin Islands of the U.S. will not affect the general analysis of diabetes in the whole United States population. We can choose to not include the missing value for the Virgin Islands of the U.S. when we analyze our data. So, we can still use this data and analyze it without loss of generality. All other data files do from U.S. Diabetes Surveillance System not have missing values.   The second missing value plot is based on our second data source, which is the questionnaire from National Center for Health Statistics. The y-axis is the codes of questions, and the x-axis represents each respondent. In the data transformation part, we have filtered our data according to the response to question DIQ010, which is whether “doctor told you have diabetes”. Since we are only interested in people who have been diagnosed with diabetes. Therefore we filter the data to include people who answered yes to this question. We can see the data from DIQ160 to DIQ180 are all missing. When we saw this many missing values, we thought we can not use this data. But as we look through all the questions inside the questionnaire, we found out that the missing values are due to the nature of the questionnaire. People will be directed to different questions based on their answers to the previous questions. There are CHECK ITEM inside the questionnaire, according to the answers to the CHECK ITEM, people will skip some questions inside the questionnaire. For example, since all the participants in our filtered data are diabetes patients, so their response to the DIQ159 CHECK ITEM is yes, and this will be directed to DIQ.050 and ignore the question from DIQ160 to DIQ180. Thus, even though there are s lot of missing values, because of the nature of the questionnaire, we think this data is still valid. All the files the third data source CDC WONDER do not have any missing values.
